                    <p>Gym goer. - From Monday to Friday I've set up myself a gym routine: I get off bed at 04:00</p>
                    <p>I like to be consistent with my schedule everyday. I get up this early to shower and grab a quick breakfast before my gym session.
                        I hop on the first bus into town at 05:30 just so that I can be in the gym for 06:00. - I am currently on a nutrition programme that helps me to stay 'fit'.
                    </p>
                    <p>Why do I start my day this early? - After I'm finished with my gym session, I'm back home around 08:00 which means I have the rest of the day
                        to do anything else. For instance, go to work or do some studies, etc.</p>

                    <div class="pra">
                        <p>- Like most people in the world, travelling is one of my passions. I like to make new friends,
                            learn new languages (or at least learn how to say 'Hello' in every country I visit).</p>
                        <p>I have currently visited 24 cities between Latin America and Europe. -
                            Fluently I speak 2 languages: Spanish (native language) & English. Although, I can communicate in French and Portuguese, I am not fluent.
                        </p>

                    <h5>Funny Stories</h5>
                    <div class="pra">
                        <p>I got lost at London Victoria (train station). I was walking around the station for about 20min
                            trying to find the exit and it was right in front of me the moment I got off the train from the airport.</p>
                            <p>A taxi driver was talking to me in a language that I assumed it was Spanish (due to its similarities to my native language)
                            and I was replying back in Spanish. We kept talking for about 30min until the gentleman told me he was
                            from a city I did not know about, so I asked in English: sorry, where is that? - He looked at me through
                            the rearview mirror and asked: where are you from? I'm from El Salvador, I said. He then said to me: 'oh, FF sake'.
                            I am from Italy and I was talking to you in Italian because I thought you were Italian and I understood everything you said. -
                            The conversation was in Spanish and Italian and we did not realise. Oh, quite an experience!</p>
                            <p>I booked a flight ticket to Geneva because it was cheap, but my final destination was Lucerne.
                            I did not know that the train ticket was going to cost me more than the flight ticket. - Little did I know
                            that I was in French territory, not in Switzerland.</p>

                    <h5>GIG & Music Festivals</h5>
                    <div class="pra">
                    <p>Other than fitness and travelling, music is another of my passions. I've gotten the opportunity
                        to see different artists and bands, like: Guns and Roses, Aerosmith, Metallica, even Shakira and her Waka-Waka song.</p>
                    <p>I always try to get the front row seat. If I'm going to pay to see a performer, I have to be at the front. - 
                        I'm always early in the queue to get in the venue. I am usually the 4th or the 5th one queueing.
                    </p>
                    <p>I usually go by myself to gigs. I rarely go with friends and when I do, I always lose them because
                        I'm always trying find the best spot closer to the stage.</p>
                        <p>I am in one of Metallica's concert video with their cover of an Irish song: Whiskey in the Jar. I'm in the minute 3:21 with my Salvadoran flag.</p>
