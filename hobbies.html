        <h1>HOBBIES</h1>
        <h2>Gym Enthusiast</h2>
        <p>Gym goer. - From Monday to Friday I've set up myself a gym routine: I get off bed at 04:00</p>
        <li>I like to be consistent with my schedule everyday.</li>
        <li>I get up this early to shower and grab a quick breakfast before my gym session.</li>
        <li>I hop on the first bus into town at 05:30 just so that I can be in the gym for 06:00</li>
        <li>I am currently on a nutrition programme that helps me to stay 'fit'.</li>
        <h3>Why do I start my day this early?</h3>
        <p>After I'm finished with my gym session, I'm back home around 08:00 which means that I have the rest of the day
            to do anything else. For instance, go to work or do some studies, etc.
        </p>

        <h2>Travelling</h2>
        <p>Like most people in the world, travelling is one of my passions. I like to make new friends,
            learn new languages (or at least learn how to say 'Hello' in every country I visit).
        </p>
        <li>I have currently visited 24 cities around the world between Latin America and Europe.</li>
        <li>Fluently I speak 2 languages: Spanish (native language) & English.</li>
        <li>I can communicate in French and Portuguese, but I am not fluent.</li>
        <h3>Funny stories:</h3>
        <li>I got lost at London Victoria (tran station). I was walking around the station for about 20min
            trying to find the exit and it was right in front of me when I got off the train from the airport.
            Silly me. - This was of course my first time in London.
        </li>
        <li>A taxi driver was talking to me in a language that I assumed it was Spanish (due to its similarities to my native language)
            and I was replying back in Spanish. We kept talking for about 30min until the gentleman told me he was
            from a city I did not know about, so I asked in English: sorry, where is that? - He looked at me through
            the rearview and asked: where are you from? I'm from El Salvador, I said. He then said to me: 'oh, FF sake'.
            I am from Italy and I was talking to you in Italian because I thought you were Italian and I understood everything you said. -
            We were speaking in Spanish and Italian and we did not realised. Oh, quite an experience!
        </li>
        <li>I booked a flight ticket to Geneva because it was cheap, but my final destination was Lucerne.
            I did not know that the train ticket was going to cost me more than the flight ticket. - Little did I know
            that I was in French territory, not in Switzerland.
        </li>

        <h2>GIG & Music Festivals</h2>
        <p>Other than fitness and travelling, music is another of my passions. I've gotten the opportunity
            to see different artists and bands, like: Guns and Roses, Aerosmith, Metallica, even Shakira and her Waka-Waka song.
        </p>
        <li>I always try to get the front row seat. If I'm going to pay to see an artist, I have to be at the front.</li>
        <li>I'm always early in the queue to get in the venue. I am usually the 4th or the 5th one queueing.</li>
        <li>I usually go by myself to gigs. I rarely go with friends and when I do, I always lose them because
            I'm always trying find the best spot closer to the stage.
        </li>
        <li>I am in one of Metallica's concert video with their cover of an Irish song: Whiskey in the Jar. I'm in the minute 3:21 with my Salvadoran flag.</li>
