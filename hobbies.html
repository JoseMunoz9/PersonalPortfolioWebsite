                    <p>Gym goer. - From Monday to Friday I've set up myself a gym routine: I get off bed at 04:00</p>
                    <p>I like to be consistent with my schedule everyday. I get up this early to shower and grab a quick breakfast before my gym session.
                        I hop on the first bus into town at 05:30 just so that I can be in the gym for 06:00. - I am currently on a nutrition programme that helps me to stay 'fit' &
                        healthy.</p>
                    <p>Why do I start my day this early? - Well, after I'm finished with my gym session, I'm back home around 08:00 and I have the rest of the day
                        to do whatever I need to. For instance: go to work, do some studies, plan my next holiday trip, etc.</p>

                    <div class="pra">
                        <p>Like most people in the world, travelling is one of my passions. I like to make new friends,
                            learn new languages (or at least learn how to say 'Hello' to people in every country I visit).</p>
                        <p>I have currently visited 24 cities between Latin America and Europe. -
                            Fluently, I speak 2 languages: Spanish (native language) & English. Although, I can communicate in French and Portuguese, I am not fluent.
                        </p>

                    <h5>Funny Stories</h5>
                    <div class="pra">
                            <p>A taxi driver was talking to me in a language that I assumed it was Spanish (due to its similarities to my native language)
                            and I was replying back in Spanish. We kept talking for about 10min until the gentleman told me he was
                            from a city I hadn't heard about before, so I asked in English: sorry, where is that? - He looked at me through
                            the rearview mirror and asked: where are you from? I'm from El Salvador, I said. He then said to me: 'oh, FF sake'.
                            I am from Italy and I was talking to you in Italian because I thought you were Italian and I understood everything you said. -
                            The conversation was in Spanish and Italian and we did not realise. Oh, quite an experience!</p>
                            <p>I booked a flight ticket to Geneva because it was cheap, but my final destination was Lucerne.
                                Had I known the train ticket was going to cost me more than the flight ticket, I would have booked a different flight. - Little did I know
                            the airport was in French territory, not Swiss.</p>

                    <h5>GIG & Music Festivals</h5>
                    <div class="pra">
                    <p>Other than fitness and travelling, music is another of my passions. I've gotten the opportunity
                        to see different artists and bands, like: Guns and Roses, Aerosmith, Metallica, even Shakira and her Waka-Waka song.</p>
                    <p>I always try to get the front row seat. If I'm going to pay to see a performer, I have to be at the front. - 
                        I'm always early in the queue to get in the venue. I am usually the 4th or the 5th one queueing.
                    </p>
                    <p>I usually go by myself to gigs. I rarely go with friends and when I do, I always lose them because
                        I'm always trying find the best spot closer to the stage.</p>
                        <p>I am in one of Metallica's concert video with their cover of an Irish song: Whiskey in the Jar. I'm in the minute 3:21 with my Salvadoran flag.</p>

                    <div class="pra">
                        <p>We are all quite aware that during the pandemic COVID-19 all the shops closed down (sadly a few of them for good).</p>
                        <p>Given the lockdowns that we were living on, nobody was able to get a haircut anywhere, <span>BUT</span> I am a self-taught person. I like to learn new skills on my own.</p>
                        <p>Having said that, I learned how to do my own haircut by watching tutorials on YouTube. - Ever since then
                            I've been doing it on my own and saving lots of money.
